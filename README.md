## Live Link

2. For the app -  [https://currencies-exchange-rates.vercel.app/](https://currencies-exchange-rates.vercel.app/)


## Specification

The page should have a header and a search bar at the top.

When the user is scrolling the page, the header should scroll off the page, but the search bar should stick to the top and stay there.

Below the header and the search bar should be a list of all currencies.

Each currency list item should contain:

 - Flag of the country
 - Name of the country
 - Currency of the country 
 - Exchange rate of that currency
 - The currencies should be searchable. The list should update according to the search results.

The search term should also be present in the URL hash and deep linking should work accordingly.
